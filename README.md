# The Daily Telegram

A local-only Telegram channel intelligence briefing system. Monitors Telegram channels, analyses posts with a locally-running Vision-Language Model via LM Studio, and generates daily ranked PDF briefings with an AI-synthesised intelligence front page — no cloud APIs, no data leaves your machine.

## How it works

```
Telegram channels
       ↓  (Telethon)
   scraper.py  →  SQLite (posts)
                      ↓
   analyzer.py  ←  LM Studio VLM
   (title, scores, category, threat_level, key entities)
                      ↓
     triage.py  (composite score, keyword boost, dedup, main/appendix split)
                      ↓
   generator.py  →  briefings/YYYY-MM-DD/TheDailyTelegram_YYYY-MM-DD-HH:MM:SS.pdf
                      ↓
  synthesiser.py  ←  LM Studio (intelligence synthesis)
   (top 20 posts → situation summary, key themes, signals & warnings, named actors)
                      ↓
   prepends intelligence front page to briefing PDF
```

Two operating modes:
- **`--batch`**: one-shot run — scrape all channels, analyse everything, generate today's PDF with intelligence front page prepended automatically
- **`--daemon`**: long-running — listen for live messages, analyse as they arrive, generate PDF daily at a configured time

---

## Prerequisites

### 1. Python 3.11+

```bash
python --version   # must be 3.11 or newer
```

### 2. Telegram API credentials

1. Go to [https://my.telegram.org/apps](https://my.telegram.org/apps) and log in
2. Create a new application (any name)
3. Note your **API ID** (integer) and **API Hash** (hex string)

### 3. LM Studio

Download from [https://lmstudio.ai](https://lmstudio.ai) and install it. You need a Vision-Language Model (VLM) loaded — one that can analyse images alongside text.

Recommended models (small and capable):
- `google/gemma-3-4b-it` — good balance of speed and quality
- `llava-v1.5-7b` — strong multimodal reasoning
- Any GGUF model with vision support

To start the server inside LM Studio: **Local Server → Start Server** (default port 1234).

## Installation

```bash
# Clone or copy the project directory, then:
cd tg_compiler

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate it
source .venv/bin/activate          # Linux / macOS
# or: .venv\Scripts\activate       # Windows

# Install the package and all dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Verify the install:
```bash
python -m tg_compiler.main --help
```

Expected output:
```
usage: tg_compiler [-h] [--config CONFIG] [--batch] [--daemon] [--generate] [--analyse] [--since TIME]
```

---

## Configuration

### Step 1 — Copy the example config

```bash
cp config.yaml.example config.yaml
```

### Step 2 — Fill in your credentials

Open `config.yaml` and edit:

```yaml
telegram:
  api_id: 123456          # your integer API ID from my.telegram.org
  api_hash: "abc123..."   # your API hash from my.telegram.org
  session_name: "briefing_session"   # filename for the session (no extension needed)
  channels:
    - username: "@channelname"   # public @username, or use id: 123456789 for private
      slug: "news"               # short identifier used in file paths and reports
      priority: 0.8
    - username: "@another_channel"
      slug: "intel"
      priority: 0.8
  rate_limit_delay_ms: 500      # pause between channel scrapes (be conservative)
  lookback_seconds: 43200       # how far back to scrape on first run (43200 = 12 hours)
                                # use --batch --since HH:MM for a one-off lookback instead

lmstudio:
  model: "google/gemma-4-12b"   # must match the model name shown in LM Studio
  server_host: "localhost"       # IP or hostname if LM Studio is on another machine
  server_port: 1234
  temperature: 0.3
  max_tokens: 800

triage:
  keywords: ["urgent", "breaking", "launch"]  # words that boost post score
  keyword_boost: 0.5        # added to composite score when a keyword matches
  min_composite_score: 3.5  # posts below this go to the Appendix section
  max_main_items: 50        # hard cap on main briefing length (overflow → appendix)

generation:
  output_dir: "./briefings"   # where PDFs are saved
  timezone: "UTC"
  generate_at: "23:59"        # time for daily auto-generation in daemon mode (HH:MM)

storage:
  db_path: "./data/briefing.db"
  media_dir: "./data/media"
  retention_days: 30          # delete media older than this many days
```

### Step 3 — Set up your `.env` file

The app loads `.env` automatically at startup. Copy the example and fill in your values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`:

```bash
TG_API_ID=123456              # overrides telegram.api_id in config.yaml
TG_API_HASH=your_api_hash     # overrides telegram.api_hash in config.yaml
LM_API_TOKEN=lms-your-token   # required if LM Studio has authentication enabled
```

`TG_API_ID` and `TG_API_HASH` override the corresponding YAML fields. `LM_API_TOKEN` is only needed if you have enabled API token authentication in LM Studio's settings.

If LM Studio is on a different machine, set `server_host` in `config.yaml` to its IP address (e.g. `192.168.1.96`).

---

## First run — Telegram authentication

The first time you run any command that connects to Telegram, Telethon will prompt you to log in interactively. This only happens once; the session is saved to `<session_name>.session`.

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m tg_compiler.main --batch
```

You will see:
```
Please enter your phone number (or bot token):
```

1. Enter your phone number in international format (e.g. `+447700900000`)
2. Telegram will send a login code to your Telegram app
3. Enter the code when prompted
4. If you have 2FA enabled, enter your password

After successful login, `briefing_session.session` is created and subsequent runs connect silently.

---

## Batch mode — one-shot scrape and report

Batch mode scrapes all configured channels, analyses every unseen post, generates today's PDF, and automatically prepends an AI-synthesised intelligence front page.

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m tg_compiler.main --batch
```

What happens:
1. Connects to Telegram
2. For each channel: fetches messages since the last run (up to 500), downloads attached photos
3. Sends each new post to LM Studio for analysis — headline title, importance, urgency, credibility, relevance, category, threat level, and key entities
4. Runs triage: scores posts, applies keyword boosts, deduplicates cross-channel reports of the same story, splits into main/appendix
5. Generates `briefings/YYYY-MM-DD/TheDailyTelegram_YYYY-MM-DD-HH:MM:SS.pdf`
6. Sends the top 20 posts by composite score to LM Studio for intelligence synthesis
7. Prepends a structured intelligence front page (situation summary, key themes, signals & warnings, named actors) to the briefing PDF
8. Disconnects

Subsequent `--batch` runs on the same day are safe — cursor tracking ensures no post is fetched twice, and UNIQUE constraints prevent duplicate DB entries. If LM Studio is unreachable during the front page step, a warning is logged and the briefing PDF is kept as-is.

Typical log output:
```
2026-06-08 09:00:01 INFO Scraped 14 new posts from news
2026-06-08 09:00:02 INFO Scraped 3 new posts from intel
2026-06-08 09:00:45 INFO Analysed 17 posts
2026-06-08 09:00:46 INFO Briefing generated: briefings/2026-06-08/TheDailyTelegram_2026-06-08-09:00:46.pdf
2026-06-08 09:00:47 INFO Synthesising intelligence assessment from 17 posts…
2026-06-08 09:01:30 INFO Intelligence front page prepended → briefings/2026-06-08/TheDailyTelegram_2026-06-08-09:00:46.pdf
```

### Re-scraping from a specific time — `--since`

To fetch posts from a point further back than the last run, use `--since`. This automatically resets channel cursors and sets the lookback window — no manual config edits needed.

```bash
# Re-scrape from midnight UTC today
python -m tg_compiler.main --batch --since 00:00

# Re-scrape from the start of a specific date
python -m tg_compiler.main --batch --since 2026-06-01

# Re-scrape from a specific date and time
python -m tg_compiler.main --batch --since 2026-06-07T06:00
```

Accepted formats: `HH:MM` (today at that UTC time), `YYYY-MM-DD` (midnight on that date), `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM` (exact UTC datetime).

**`--since` resets channel cursors** so the scraper re-fetches from Telegram. Already-seen posts hit the `UNIQUE(channel_id, message_id)` constraint and are silently discarded — no duplicate DB entries. Already-analysed posts are skipped by `get_unanalysed_posts()` — no LLM calls are wasted. The downside is Telegram still has to serve those message pages, which wastes API quota.

> **Use `--since` only when you intentionally need a historical lookback.** For routine same-day re-runs, use plain `--batch` — it uses the cursor and fetches only messages that arrived since the last run.

---

## Daemon mode — live monitoring

Daemon mode runs indefinitely, listening for new messages in real time and generating a PDF automatically at the configured `generate_at` time each day.

> **Important:** The daemon is a live listener only. It processes messages that arrive while it is running — it does **not** backfill historical posts. Always run `--batch` first to catch up on any posts you want in the briefing, then start the daemon.

```bash
# Recommended startup sequence:
python -m tg_compiler.main --batch   # catch up on history first
python -m tg_compiler.main --daemon  # then switch to live monitoring
```

### Start LM Studio first

Ensure LM Studio is running with a model loaded before starting the daemon:
- Open LM Studio → Local Server tab → click **Start Server**
- Confirm the server shows "Running on port 1234"

### Start the daemon

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m tg_compiler.main --daemon
```

What happens at startup:
1. Opens a Telegram client session
2. Resolves all configured channels and registers a live message listener
3. Spawns a background scheduler for daily briefing generation
4. Logs: `Daemon running on N channels`

What happens when a new message arrives:
1. Downloads attached media (if any)
2. Inserts a `PostRecord` into SQLite
3. Sends the post to LM Studio for analysis (including threat level) and saves the result
4. Duplicate posts (by channel_id + message_id) are silently skipped

What happens at `generate_at` time each day:
1. Runs triage on all posts analysed that day
2. Generates `briefings/YYYY-MM-DD/TheDailyTelegram_YYYY-MM-DD-HH:MM:SS.pdf`
3. Purges media directories older than `retention_days`

### Stopping the daemon

Press `Ctrl+C`. The Telegram client disconnects cleanly.

### Running as a background service (optional)

```bash
# Using nohup
nohup python -m tg_compiler.main --daemon > logs/daemon.log 2>&1 &
echo $! > daemon.pid

# Stop it later
kill $(cat daemon.pid)
```

Or use a systemd service unit if running on Linux.

## Generating a report manually

If you have posts in the database but want to regenerate today's report without re-scraping:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m tg_compiler.main --generate
```

To prepend the intelligence front page to an existing briefing PDF (e.g. after a `--generate`):

```bash
python -m tg_compiler.main --analyse
# or for a specific date:
python -m tg_compiler.main --analyse --since 2026-06-07
```

`--analyse` finds the most recent `TheDailyTelegram_*.pdf` in the date subdirectory, synthesises the top 20 posts via LM Studio, and prepends the front page. Under `--batch` this runs automatically, so `--analyse` is mainly useful after a standalone `--generate`.

---

## Reading the reports

Reports are written to date-named subdirectories under `./briefings/` (configurable via `generation.output_dir`).

```
briefings/
└── 2026-06-08/
    ├── TheDailyTelegram_2026-06-08-09:00:46.pdf   ← primary report (with front page)
    └── briefing_2026-06-08.md                      ← Markdown source
```

Each `--batch` or `--generate` run writes a new uniquely timestamped PDF. The `.md` file is the source of truth and is overwritten on each run.

### Report structure

**Intelligence Front Page** — prepended automatically. Contains:
- *Situation Summary* — 3-5 sentence analyst overview of the day's geopolitical picture
- *Key Themes* — 3-5 cross-cutting patterns across today's reports
- *Signals & Warnings* — 3-5 developments to watch with observable indicators
- *Named Actors* — 4-6 most significant actors and their activity today

**Executive Summary** — top 10 posts across all channels, one line each with threat level badge, category, headline, and channel attribution.

**Per-channel sections** — posts that cleared `min_composite_score`, sorted by composite score descending, capped at `max_main_items` total (excess goes to the Appendix). Cross-channel duplicates (same story reported by multiple channels within 2 hours, detected by word overlap ≥28% or ≥3 shared named entities) are deduplicated — only the highest-scoring report appears. Each entry shows:
- **Threat level badge**: 🔴 CRITICAL · 🟠 HIGH · 🟡 MODERATE · 🟢 LOW
- **Category** in backtick style: `` `Breaking News` `` / `` `Analysis` `` / `` `Official Statement` `` / `` `Rumor` `` / `` `Media` `` / `` `Other` ``
- LLM-generated headline title (5-10 words)
- Post timestamp and direct link to the original Telegram post (↗ t.me)
- Full summary from the VLM
- Composite score out of 5
- Key named entities
- Image analysis excerpt (if the post had a substantive image)
- Attached images (up to 3, embedded in PDF)

**Appendix** — posts that scored below `min_composite_score`, listed compactly with direct Telegram links.

**Statistics table** — total posts, main/appendix counts, channels covered, and a per-category breakdown.

### Threat level scale

| Badge | Level | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 🔴 | CRITICAL | Imminent mass casualty risk, confirmed state-level military action, nuclear/chemical/biological threat, or attack on critical infrastructure |
| 🟠 | HIGH | Confirmed armed conflict development, significant political crisis, major terror attack, or credible escalation warning from a named senior official |
| 🟡 | MODERATE | Ongoing conflict updates, diplomatic developments, significant arrests, or unverified but plausible escalation claims |
| 🟢 | LOW | Background context, routine troop movement reports, unverified rumours, or historical/statistical reports |

### Composite scoring formula

```
score = 0.4 × importance + 0.3 × urgency + 0.2 × credibility + 0.1 × relevance
```

Each dimension is rated 1–5 by the VLM. A post with all 5s scores 5.0. Keyword matches add `keyword_boost` (default 0.5) to the score, capped at 5.0.

## Troubleshooting

**"No module named tg_compiler"**  
The virtual environment is not active. Run `source .venv/bin/activate` first.

**"LM Studio is not reachable" / connection refused on port 1234**  
LM Studio server is not running, or `server_host`/`server_port` in `config.yaml` don't match. Start it via LM Studio → Local Server → Start Server. If LM Studio runs on another machine, set `lmstudio.server_host` to its IP address. The app uses LM Studio's OpenAI-compatible HTTP endpoint (`/v1/chat/completions`) — ensure "Enable API server" is on.

**"ChannelPrivateError"**  
Your Telegram account is not a member of that channel. Join it in the Telegram app and retry.

**"FloodWaitError: X seconds"**  
Telegram rate-limited the request. The scraper will pause automatically and resume. If it happens often, increase `rate_limit_delay_ms`.

**"ValidationError: extra inputs are not permitted"**  
A field in `config.yaml` is misspelled or unknown. Check the field name against `config.yaml.example`.

**"TG_API_ID env var must be an integer"**  
The `TG_API_ID` environment variable is set but contains a non-integer value. Either unset it or fix the value.

**PDF is empty or has no posts**  
Either no posts were scraped today, or LM Studio analysis has not run yet. Run `--batch` to trigger a full scrape+analyse cycle, then check `--generate`.

**Intelligence front page not prepended**  
If LM Studio was unreachable during the synthesis step, a warning is logged and the briefing is kept as-is. Check LM Studio is running and retry with `--analyse`.

**Session file issues after moving the project**  
Delete `<session_name>.session` and re-authenticate by running `--batch` again.
